    "   I want to filter my searches through various salaries. Build timed for loops for pluck job title, company, description, location. May also want to broaden my location range (currently set to within 25 miles of Chicago). After making a list of data for each salary range I need to concat all my lists into one data frame. Then I need to drop all dups. Add a column to show salary. Define high_salary and document, add as a column. Search through for common words, CountVectorizer (for the body of dataframe). Determine the words that appear most often (which ones of them correlate to high_salary?). Begin thinking about which models to use, run the models, pick best three and talk about them. "
